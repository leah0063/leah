<i>Osmanthus fragrans</i>

can be used to treat cough and asthma due to phlegm, cold pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, etc. "Pharmacology of Traditional Chinese Medicine" records the effectiveness of osmanthus in removing bad breath. "Anhui Chinese Herbal Medicine" and "Zhejiang Medicinal Flora" both record that osmanthus mainly treats stomach cold and abdominal pain, and also has the effect of treating phlegm and cough. In addition to its medicinal value, osmanthus can also be processed into osmanthus cake for consumption. In addition to its therapeutic value, the osmanthus tree also has ornamental value. Its tree shape is upright and elegant, and its soft lines give people a sense of stability and peace.</br></p>
